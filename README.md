# Definition
The supply Chain is the network of production and logistics involved in producing and delivering goods to customers. And Supply Chain Analysis means analyzing various components of a Supply Chain to understand how to improve the effectiveness of the Supply Chain to create more value for customers.

# Analysis
![supplychain 1](https://github.com/SyedsPortfolio/Supply-Chain-Analysis/assets/147240839/7d096cc5-8075-4371-865c-d6d55a6d2340)

the company derives more revenue from skincare products, and the higher the price of skincare products, the more revenue they generate.

![supplychain 2](https://github.com/SyedsPortfolio/Supply-Chain-Analysis/assets/147240839/0a37c8d7-16be-4266-a6b8-8a711566fa9d)

So 45% of the business comes from skincare products, 29.5% from haircare, and 25.5% from cosmetics.

So the company is using three carriers for transportation, and Carrier B helps the company in generating more revenue.

# Analyzing SKUs
Thereâ€™s a column in the dataset as SKUs. You must have heard it for the very first time. So, SKU stands for Stock Keeping Units. Theyâ€™re like special codes that help companies keep track of all the different things they have for sale. Imagine you have a large toy store with lots of toys. Each toy is different and has its name and price, but when you want to know how many you have left, you need a way to identify them. So you give each toy a unique code, like a secret number only the store knows. This secret number is called SKU.

Thereâ€™s another column in the dataset as Stock levels. Stock levels refer to the number of products a store or business has in its inventory.

Now letâ€™s have a look at the order quantity of each SKU:

# Cost Analysis

Now letâ€™s analyze the shipping cost of Carriers:

![supplychain 8](https://github.com/SyedsPortfolio/Supply-Chain-Analysis/assets/147240839/bb14c8fb-c6ef-42c7-a37a-688237ff312b)

we discovered that Carrier B helps the company in more revenue. It is also the most costly Carrier among the three.

![supplychain 9](https://github.com/SyedsPortfolio/Supply-Chain-Analysis/assets/147240839/b848b5cd-729f-407a-9225-4b1e999a91cd)

So the company spends more on Road and Rail modes of transportation for the transportation of Goods.

# Analyzing Defect Rate

The defect rate in the supply chain refers to the percentage of products that have something wrong or are found broken after shipping.

![supplychain 10](https://github.com/SyedsPortfolio/Supply-Chain-Analysis/assets/147240839/3433c643-67a9-4a1e-ad90-7d2df0c5c57c)

So the defect rate of haircare products is higher.

![supplychain 11](https://github.com/SyedsPortfolio/Supply-Chain-Analysis/assets/147240839/a2594163-9694-4980-9ba4-da4a5f8fd4e9)

Road transportation results in a higher defect rate, and Air transportation has the lowest defect rate.
